# Software requirements:

# Introduction:

# Structure of input data for MISPEL:
The input images should be a paired dataset which includes images of ALL subjects across ALL scanners. We expect all images to be grouped in n (# of scanners) folders. These folders should be named after the scanner names. Also, images of each subject should have identical names across these folders. Please refer to [Data folder](https://github.com/Mahbaneh/MISPEL/tree/main/Data) as an example of the structure of the input data for MISPEL.
